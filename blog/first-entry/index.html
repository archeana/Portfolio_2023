        <h2 style="color:aqua; padding: 8px; margin: 20px">This is my very first blog entry.</h2>
        <ol class="bloglist">
            <li><strong>Extension</strong> I started doing this website using the tutorial from <a
                    href="https://code.makery.ch">Code
                    makery</a>. The first thing I learned was how to add an extension to the Visual Studio code Editor.
                The "Live server" extension. I have been using Visual Studio Code for 2 months and did not know that
                existed. Now I can see it live, instead of running and
                opening in the browser and accidentally running the CSS script instead of the HTML.</li>
            <li><strong>Publish website.</strong> I learn how to publish my website on Netlify. Wow is so easy to
                "publish" just drop
                the folder. It is definitely easier than Github, but do I have to drop the folder all the
                time? We will see when I finish.</li>
            <img src="/blog/first-entry/web1.png" alt="website1" style="width: 30%;margin:5%; align-items: center;">
            <li><strong>CSS</strong> CSS is how to make HTML look pretty. I learn a lot of basic
                things that I did not know. Using the DevTools is so much cool.
                I can see if something is not working and I don't need to delete in VScode I can just click and unclick
                and see
                what is the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Pages</strong> I actually did not know how this worked. I did a
                course ~2 hours a week to learn to do a website and in the end, we had to do a website in our group.
                When I was
                doing this course, we divided the job by 4 so each person had ca.3 pages to do and we made one html and
                CSS for
                each. It was such a headache afterwards to add all to one website. But now I read this post on how to
                create pages
                and makes so much sense. Mindblowing. Now I created all the html and folders for this website.</li>
            <li><strong>Format document in VScode</strong> I just discover the "format document" so useful now my code
                looks so neat ^-^. I just started watching youtube videos on Flexbox, Bootstrap and ways to do layouts.
                I try a couple of them and then got stuck.</li>
            <li><strong>Favicon</strong> I learn to add a favicon. I use Canva to do the icon and then
                add it to the website. Now looks cool. I started doing the navbar using Flexbox. I used this youtube to
                guide me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pidsgeLLzE">Youtube video</a>. Some parts did not work so I need to figure it out. Like
                the images go under the navbar. ?? I wanted to make it responsive to all devices. But in the end, it was too complicated and it did not
                work.</li>

        </ol>
