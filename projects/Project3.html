    <h2>Financial Habits Quiz</h2>
    <p>Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz project! This README file will provide you with an overview
      of
      the project, its structure, and how to use it.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz is a web-based interactive quiz that aims to help users understand their
      financial habits and identify areas where they can improve their expenses and save money. The quiz consists of
      17
      questions, each with multiple-choice answers. After answering each question, users will receive specific tips
      and,
      in some cases, links to additional resources. This was a project for a Challenge from CFG where each team had to
      build a product, app, or website that will empower everyday citizens to manage their budgets and help alleviate
      the challenges of the current cost of living crisis.</p>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project consists of an HTML file with embedded JavaScript for interactivity. The structure of the project
      can
      be broken down into the following sections:</p>

    <h3>Landing Page</h3>
    <p>The landing page includes a welcoming message and an invitation to take the quiz. Users are prompted to click
      the
      "Let's Begin" button and provide their name to start the quiz.
    </p>
    <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
    <p>The quiz is divided into multiple pages, with one page for each question. Each question page includes the
      question
      text and multiple answer buttons. After selecting an answer, users will receive feedback and tips related to
      their
      choice. Users can navigate between questions using the "Next" and "Back" buttons. The "Back" button allows users
      to revisit the previous question.</p>

    <h3>Completion Page</h3>
    <p>After answering all 17 questions, users are presented with a "Last" button to complete the quiz. Once
      completed,
      users receive a thank-you message and an invitation to visit the Budget Bliss website for more information.</p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>To use the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the HTML file in a web browser.</li>
      <li>On the landing page, click the "Let's Begin" button, and you will be prompted
        to enter your name. </li>
      <li>Provide your name, and the quiz will start. </li>
      <li>Answer each question by clicking one of the answer
        buttons.</li>
      <li>After answering a question, you will receive feedback and tips based on your choice. Use the
        "Next"button to proceed to the next question or the "Back" button to revisit the previous question. Complete
        all 17
        questions.</li>
      <li> After the final question, click the "Last" button to receive a thank-you message. You can click on
        the provided links in the feedback to explore additional resources.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
    <p>The quiz requires user interaction, and it is recommended to provide your name to personalize the experience.
      The "Next" button is disabled until an answer is selected, so please make a choice for each question. The
      project
      includes placeholder URLs for feedback links that connect to the website of Budget Bliss. The project's
      interactivity and functionality are based on JavaScript, so ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your web
      browser.
      Enjoy taking the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz and gain valuable insights into your financial habits! If
      you have any questions or feedback, feel free to send me a message.
