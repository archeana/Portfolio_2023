Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz
Welcome to the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz project! This README file will provide you with an overview of the project, its structure, and how to use it.

Project Overview
The Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz is a web-based interactive quiz that aims to help users understand their financial habits and identify areas where they can improve their expenses and save money. The quiz consists of 17 questions, each with multiple-choice answers. After answering each question, users will receive specific tips and, in some cases, links to additional resources. This was a project for a Challenge from CFG where each team had to build a product, app, or website that will empower everyday citizens to manage their budgets and help alleviate the challenges of the current cost of living crisis.

Project Structure
The project consists of an HTML file with embedded JavaScript for interactivity. The structure of the project can be broken down into the following sections:

Landing Page
The landing page includes a welcoming message and an invitation to take the quiz. Users are prompted to click the "Let's Begin" button and provide their name to start the quiz.

Questions and Answers
The quiz is divided into multiple pages, with one page for each question. Each question page includes the question text and multiple answer buttons. After selecting an answer, users will receive feedback and tips related to their choice. Users can navigate between questions using the "Next" and "Back" buttons. The "Back" button allows users to revisit the previous question.

Completion Page
After answering all 17 questions, users are presented with a "Last" button to complete the quiz. Once completed, users receive a thank-you message and an invitation to visit the Budget Bliss website for more information.

Usage
To use the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz, follow these steps:

Open the HTML file in a web browser. On the landing page, click the "Let's Begin" button, and you will be prompted to enter your name. Provide your name, and the quiz will start. Answer each question by clicking one of the answer buttons. After answering a question, you will receive feedback and tips based on your choice. Use the "Next" button to proceed to the next question or the "Back" button to revisit the previous question. Complete all 17 questions. After the final question, click the "Last" button to receive a thank-you message. You can click on the provided links in the feedback to explore additional resources.

Important Notes
The quiz requires user interaction, and it is recommended to provide your name to personalize the experience. The "Next" button is disabled until an answer is selected, so please make a choice for each question. The project includes placeholder URLs for feedback links that connect to the website of Budget Bliss. The project's interactivity and functionality are based on JavaScript, so ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser. Enjoy taking the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz and gain valuable insights into your financial habits! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to send me a message.
